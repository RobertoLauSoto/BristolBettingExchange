# BristolBettingExchange

Roberto Lau-Soto's 2021 MEng Individual Project

This presents my implementation of the Bristol Betting Exchange project proposed by Dave Cliff, built in Python and single-threaded. The libraries needed to run the application locally are NumPy and Matplotlib.

All content inside 'cloud' folder is the cloud-based prototype version of my implementation - currently it only works on my personal Linux machine with my AWS account details, but it provides a potential alternative for deploying this project.
